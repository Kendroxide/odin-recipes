<h1>Belgian Waffles</h1>
 <img src="../img/belgian-waffle.jpg" alt="two fluffy waffles stacked ontop of each other with
  a pat of butter">  
  <p><em>These waffles are crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. One of my favorite 
    breakfasts on the weekend. The recipe will yeild enough for 4 servings. I usually store the 
    reminder in a zip lock bag and can re-heat in the toaster or air fryer. Also great frozen!

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup white flour</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>2 eggs, seperated</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
    <li>Splash of vanilla</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl</li>
    <li>Seperate the egg yolk from the white. Each should go in a seperate bowl</li>
    <li>Using electric beaters, beat the egg whites until a stiff peak. Set aside for now</li>
    <li>Mix the egg yolks, milk, butter and vanilla. Mix until smooth</li>
    <li>Pour the egg, milk, vanilla and butter into the dry ingredients. Mix until there are 
        no lumps</li>
    <li>Add the egg whites and carefully fold into the batter with a spatula. Be careful not to 
        over mix. There should be lumps of egg whites.</li>
    <li>Let it sit for 15 minutes while waffle iron is heating up. It is important that you
         let the batter rest.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the waffle iron and cook. I like to top this with a fruit sauce.</li>
