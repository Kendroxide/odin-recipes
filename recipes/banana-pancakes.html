    <p><em> These are easy to make and a great way to use up old bananas. By adding protein powder,
        these pack a nutritionally dense morning breakfast and are quick to make. </em></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large or 3 small bananas</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>Half cup protein poweder (can substitute white flour)</li>
        <li>Half cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>Splash of vanilla</li>
        <li>Teaspoon of cinnamon poweder</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash bananas with a fork until a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Mix in eggs and beat together</li>
        <li>Pour in butter slowely while mixing. This ensures that the hot butter
            does not cook the eggs. Butter should also be allowed to cool slightly if hot.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients and whisk together</li>
        <li>Allow the batter to rest for at least 10 minutes. This will allow the rolled oats
            to absorb some of the moister and creates a better consistency.</li>
        <li>Cook on a lightly oiled pan at low heat</li>
        <li>I like to top the pancakes with peanut butter. Feel free to use nutella, 
            syrup, honey or fresh fruit instead.</li>
    </ol>
